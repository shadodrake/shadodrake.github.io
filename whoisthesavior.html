        As I listened to Elder Uchtdorf give his talk, <a href=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/04/behold-the-man?lang=eng&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtMCKBhDAARIsAG-2Eu_S13oklvgqKnZKbmI5JAhH1BftFV9SGPBflUxZOmlBTwChq8RJafwaAjVeEALw_wcB target=_blank>"Behold the Man"</a>,
        I questioned the phrase. Elder Uchtorf lovingly talked about what it means to behold Jesus Christ, but I found myself more troubled by the phrase.
        Jesus Christ was more than a man and I really wanted to explore that concept. Who was "the man?"
