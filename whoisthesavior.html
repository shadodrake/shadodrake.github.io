        <h1>Who is the Savior?</h1>

            As I listened to Elder Uchtdorf give his talk, <a href=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/04/behold-the-man?lang=eng&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtMCKBhDAARIsAG-2Eu_S13oklvgqKnZKbmI5JAhH1BftFV9SGPBflUxZOmlBTwChq8RJafwaAjVeEALw_wcB target=_blank>"Behold the Man"</a>,
            I questioned the phrase. Elder Uchtorf lovingly talked about what it means to behold Jesus Christ, but I found myself more troubled by the phrase.
            Jesus Christ was more than a man and I really wanted to explore that concept. Who was "the man?"
        </p>

        <h3>John 19:5</h3>
        <p class="scripture">
            Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe.
            And <em>Pilate</em> saith unto them, <strong>Behold the man!</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>The "man"</h2>
        <h4>Jesus of Nazareth</h4>
        <p>
            Pilate, in trying to wash his hands of his guilt, missed it. He told them to behold a <em>man</em>,
            an innocent mortal, not <em>the Son of God</em>. His intention was certainly misguided but I believe he 
            thought it to be relatively pure. he scourged Christ in an effort to appeal to the Jew's humanity. 
            Pilate, a Roman and worshiper of gods such as Jupiter and Neptune, 
            the same wicked judge who had effectively spat upon the Jewish faith <em>(see Jesus the Christ)</em>
            was now simply trying to have the Jews see what he did: 
            an innocent man who was being tried unjustly and deserved to be set free.          
        </p>
        <h4>Jesus, the Carpenter's Son</h4>
        <p>
            The Jews on the other hand, or rather the ruling class of the Jews, had become a hypocritical people. 
            They only wanted power and influence over their people. They not only feared the influence that 
            Christ was gaining that was taking away their esteem, but they also feared the Romans would see Christ 
            and his gathering as an attempt to revolt. Either way, this would lead to a decline in their power and their influence. 
            While Pilate saw an innocent man, they saw a threat. A blasphemer, liar, and hypocrite. 
            Through <strong>their</strong> hypocritically blinded eyes, they saw an enemy who had to be crucified.

        </p>
        <h4>Jesus, the Messiah</h4>
        <p>
            His Disciples knew. They beheld not a man, but the Son of God. How they must have wept. 
            Unfortunately they believed this to be a great tragedy, an end to what was supposed to be a Messianic Reign. 
            The Supreme Lord of Heaven and Earth crucified without saying a word. They did not yet realize quite what they were beholding. 
            To them, they beheld the Son of God at the mercy of Jew and Gentile alike. 
        </p>
        <h4><em>His</em> Son</h4>
        <p>
            This is most certainly the greatest tragedy of that day. 
            When Pilate told the Jews to "Behold the man", and the Jews beheld a threat, and the disciples beheld the Messiah defeated, God beheld His Son. 
            His faithful and true Son who obeyed all the commands of His Father. His Firstborn, submissive as a child. 
            How terrible His wrath must have been towards the hearts of those who stood in an attempt to crucify His Son. 
            And yet, when the Jews cried "crucify him" I can only imagine that through tears, the Father must have hollowly echoed the same words. 
            "Yes, crucify Him, because He is the only one who can save the rest of you. Crucify your Savior through hate and He will free you out of His love." 
            The Father recognized the importance of this moment and He, in his infinite love to the rest of us, resigned at the words of the wicked, "crucify him".
