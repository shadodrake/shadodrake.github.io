        <p>
            Throughout the course of my life, I have been inspired by a variety of Gospel Topics.
            This is a place where I can share my thoughts, feelings, and impressions of those topics.
            Right now, it is quite simple, but I hope as my knowledge of coding grows, so will my ability to format
            this website in the best way for you to experience my thoughts.
