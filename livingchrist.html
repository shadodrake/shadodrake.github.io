        <h1>Understanding the Living Christ</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            As I read the document, <a href=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/36035_000_25_livingchrist.pdf" target="blank">The Living Christ</a>, 
            I questioned the significance of that title. Jesus Christ has many names, see my thoughts on each name I have found thus far <a href=hehasmanynames.html target="blank">here.</a>
            With so many options, what led the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles to settle on focusing on this specific name? Certainly they had their reasons.
            This study is my attempt to find the importance and eternal significance of that name.
